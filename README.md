# Roulette
A web app for the indecisive; after registering for an account, users can create decisions from which a choice is picked at random. Built with Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy backend and Bootstrap4 front end.

## Motivation
I often get asked, "what should we eat," so I thought it would be cool to randomize that decision. I decided that the idea could be applied to any decision, so I made a web app. This is also my first time working with databases, so getting exposure to that was another plus. 

## How it Works
Users create "decisions" and create options for those decisions. An option is picked at random after pressing the roulette button. C.R.U.D operations can be performed on decisions and the options within them.
